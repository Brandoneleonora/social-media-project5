# Phase 5 Social Media Website Project

This is a social media website where you can post things and see other peoples post as well

## Introduction

This is a very bland and not well done website but, it is my first full stack website so whatever suggestions you can leave to improve the functionallity of the code will be much appreciated

## Description 

You first need to open two seperate terminals 

The first terminal you will need to do:
```bash
pipenv install; pipenv shell
```

Once that is done next you want to run:
```bash
python server/app.py
```

If this is done correctly you will then have you back end running on localhost:5555

For you front end terminal it is simpler just type in:
```bash
npm install
```
then cd into the client folder and then run:
```bash
npm start
```
whole thing should be up and running
